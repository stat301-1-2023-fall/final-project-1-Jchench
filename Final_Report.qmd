Introduction
Overview of the EDA. What was the motivation for this analysis? What initial curiosities or research questions motivated you? Describe the data source(s) you will use to build a predictive model. If you are obtaining information from websites you should cite those in your References.

Data overview & quality
A concise high level overview of the dataset(s) being explored. Description of the dataset(s) that covers basics: size, number of observations, number, of variables, variable types, and discussion of any quality issues (especially missingness and how it may impact the analysis). Highlight any important data collection issues or concerns. If over-technical, but important, then place technical details in Appendix: technical info.

Explorations
This is the heart or main body of the the report. The structure of this portion can look VERY different depending on narrative choices and organization choices made to guide readers through the project EDA. Could decide to make sections for major parts of the EDA and not used an Explorations header. The key is that you have sections that are clearly organized and guide the reader through a systematic and thoughtful exploration of the dataset(s).

A thoughtful exploration weaves together prose, figures, and tables to help a reader build understanding. It is a guided tour that should have clear motivations for each step in the process (think guiding curiosities or research questions). It should be clear how things build of of each other and why we are looking at what is being presented. Should also be letting the reader know whether what is shown is as expected or is it surprising (maybe some of each).

You could imagine structuring this section around analysis type: univariate, bivariate, and multivariate. Can be a little harder to build a narrative with this structure. Could build sections that are dedicated to important variables: variable 1, variable 2, etc. In this case the sections would thoroughly explore the section’s variable through univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses. Alternatively, could build your sections around broad curiosities/research questions. Some of which probably inspired the project, and others that were developed through conducting the EDA.

Conclusion
State conclusions or insights. Were you surprised by things you found or were they as expected? Why? This is a great place for future work, new research questions, and next steps.

References — if needed
Any references used should be sited here. This includes but is not limited to where you got your data. There is no “formal” reference guideline but we recommend APA format. Example: Lastname, F. M. (Year, Month Date). Title of page. Site name. URL

Appendix: technical info — if needed
A place to share complex and important technical steps that may highly impact explorations, but the details are too technical to share in main body of the report.

Appendix: extra explorations — if needed
Useful in cases where there are an over-abundance of explorations and they are not useful in the main body of the report or they are uninteresting, but still think readers should have access to them for reference.
